### Hello and welcome to my repository ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paulina and I'm based in Warsaw, Poland. I'm currently working in a Polish IT Company in an interdisciplinary team of professionals. 
Thanks to my English language teaching education and experience I am a very conscious and fast learner. Moreover, I work in an international team on daily basis, communicating both in English and Polish. 
Thanks to my marketing background I have been able to jump into an ongoing project and became a valuable member of the team from my very first days at work in R&D e-commerce project.
Thanks to my buddy I have learned the project application in just days.
Thanks to my Project Manager's trust I have been able to develop my testing and managing skills. After R&D phase I am managing SLA Jira and Redmine of the project for both business and development team.

I am committed thus I never leave an issue unresolved.
I am communicative and taking the initiative thus I am an active member of the team.
I am professional thus I am constantly improving my tech skills.
Moreover I am very proud and happy of the progress I have made during my 9-months experience as a Software tester.

At the moment I am upgrading my testing skills such as: writing test cases and scenarios from business documentation in both: Microsoft (Word,Excel) and dedicated to testing (Qase) software under the supervision of my senior collegue. At the same time I am a mentoree of senior automatic tester Bartosz Kita, whose backend testing course I am attending (Postman with tests in JavaScript, Java, Selenium and tools like Cmdr, Git, JSON-server along the way).
