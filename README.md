### Hello and welcome to my repository ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paulina and I'm based in Warsaw, Poland. I'm currently working in a Polish IT Company in an interdisciplinary team of professionals. 
Thanks to my English language teaching education and experience I am a very conscious and fast learner. Moreover, I work in an international team on daily basis, communicating both in English and Polish. 
Thanks to my marketing background I have been able to jump into an ongoing project and became a valuable member of the team from my very first days at work in R&D e-commerce project.
Thanks to my buddy I have learned the project application in just days.
Thanks to my Project Manager's trust I have been able to develop my testing and managing skills. After R&D phase I am managing SLA Jira and Redmine of the project for both business and development team.

I am interested in improving my testing skills as well as being a product owner in more complicated projects.

I am committed thus I never leave an issue unresolved.
I am communicative and taking the initiative thus I am an active member of the team.
I am professional thus I am constantly improving my tech skills.
